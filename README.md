> In microservices orchestration, the orchestrator is the brain, or logic component, that assigns tasks to the microservices. On obtaining a transaction request or a query, the orchestrator decides on the workflow and distributes tasks to the microservices. Each microservice is concerned only with the assigned task and not the overall workflow.
